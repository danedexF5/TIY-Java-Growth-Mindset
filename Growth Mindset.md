# Growth Mindset


I **really** enjoyed the article. I think it relates perfectly to the situation I'm currently in so it really hit home for me while reading it.

During and after reading it I was doing a bit of self reflecting and examinging exactly how it applies and could apply to me.

Even before reading it, keeping a positive mindset has been something that has been a point of emphasis for me. Trying to stave off doubt and keep going forward is helpful. The course has been difficult though so frustration and defeatism have percolated. I keep thinking that despite that there is only one option and that is to keep trying to improve. It's been hard to stay positive though, that's just the truth. 

This article does reinforce a mindset though. 

-Trying to get better is ultimately where I want to be. 

-Remaining the same isn't where I want to be. 

It's easier said than done at the moment but I hope to incorporate this mindset into the class as much as I can.
